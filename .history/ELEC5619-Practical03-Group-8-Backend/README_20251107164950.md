# NutriFit AI Backend

## Introduction / Overview
- Designed to deliver personalized fitness and nutrition coaching through a secure, scalable Spring Boot backend.
- Centralizes workout planning, macro tracking, and progress analytics into a unified data-driven ecosystem.
- Demonstrates enterprise-grade API orchestration and AI-assisted insights capable of scaling from individual users to high-volume deployments.

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Framework | Spring Boot 3, Java 17 | Production-grade REST services with actuator, validation, and modular starters |
| Data | PostgreSQL + Spring Data JPA + HikariCP | Reliable relational storage, optimized pooling, and schema-driven models |
| Security | Spring Security, JWT, BCrypt, Mailgun SMTP | Tokenized auth, strong password hashing, outbound email flows |
| AI & Analytics | Gemini API, custom inference services, iText PDF | AI calorie prediction, conversational insights, formalized PDF coaching packs |
| Tooling | Maven Wrapper, Lombok, JaCoCo | Reproducible builds, trimmed boilerplate, automated coverage reporting |

## Key Features
- **JWT-authenticated account lifecycle** covering registration, verification, login, refresh, and secure password resets through Mailgun-powered notifications.
- **Profile + body metrics module** capturing BMI/BMR calculations, paginated histories, and insight-ready telemetry.
- **Workout orchestration** with CRUD endpoints, structured metadata, filters, and AI-suggested burn estimates for fast planning.
- **Nutrition intelligence** that ingests meals, aggregates macros, and surfaces daily summaries for data-driven eating decisions.
- **Dashboard + reporting** pipelines that deliver JSON snapshots and branded PDF reports via iText for executive-ready sharing.
- **Operational readiness** through profile-based configuration, environment overrides, and cloud-friendly containerization defaults.

## AI Integration
- Integrates Gemini-backed services for calorie prediction, workout generation, and contextual nutrition guidance.
- Wraps AI prompts in a policy layer to sanitize inputs, enforce role-based scopes, and log inference metadata for traceability.
- Feeds inference results back into the metrics store, enabling adaptive planning based on user adherence trends.

## Architecture Highlights
- **Modular packages** (auth, profile, workout, nutrition, insights) keep domain logic isolated and easy to extend.
- **Layered service + repository pattern** encourages unit-testable business rules and consistent transaction handling.
- **Asynchronous mail + notification gateways** decouple outbound communication and protect the request thread pool.
- **Centralized security filters** enforce JWT validation, CORS policy, and least-privilege access across every endpoint.
- **Cloud-readiness**: stateless services, environment-driven secrets, and PostgreSQL compatibility with managed offerings like RDS.

## Testing & Code Quality
- Achieved 87% line coverage with JUnit 5, Mockito, and JaCoCo instrumentation.
- Segregated unit tests by layer (security, repository, controller) to accelerate CI feedback.
- Automated build verification through Maven Wrapper for reproducible test pipelines.
- Key commands:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw clean verify            # full build + unit tests + JaCoCo report
  ./mvnw jacoco:report           # regenerate HTML coverage dashboard
  ```

## Setup Instructions (concise)
1. **Prerequisites**: Install JDK 17+, Maven Wrapper, PostgreSQL 14+, and export credentials via environment variables (`SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_API_KEY`).
2. **Configure profiles**: Update `src/main/resources/application-dev.yml` or supply overrides for datasource, JWT secrets, and Mailgun domains.
3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   # or
   java -jar target/nutrifit-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
4. **Access**: API defaults to `http://localhost:8080` with the `dev` profile; set `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` for staging/production parity.

## Future Improvements
Future iterations aim to enhance scalability, intelligence, and real-time analytics across multiple deployment environments.
- Expand AI coaching with reinforcement signals from wearable integrations.
- Introduce multi-tenant org controls for enterprises running corporate wellness programs.
- Add WebSocket push channels for real-time dashboard updates and anomaly alerts.
- Harden observability via OpenTelemetry traces, SLIs, and auto-scaling policies for peak training seasons.
